With the rise of additive manufacturing in the new revolution of the industrial process, more and more industries try to replace the traditional methods to enhance accessibility and productivity. Designers and engineers have more rooms to demonstrate or redesign the product to achieve better part tolerance, reduce cost, etc. Also, future space programs like Martian missions require more sustainable and reliable manufacturing processes. Therefore, research that discusses additive manufacturing’s potential improvement is necessary to reduce the cost per product and other main principles. First, the upgrade of software and the internet transmission, which consider smart manufacturing, will improve the process and gain accessibility, “The basic idea of smart manufacturing involves flexibility in systems, monitoring, and adaptation to changing needs” (Kumar, 2017). This article’s discussion will focus on additive manufacturing potential, especially in systematizing the progress and machines, including the resources. In systematizing the process, the combination and optimization of manufacturing machines will first be analyzed as the internet of things (IoT). Furthermore, as additive manufacturing is more capable of a future space mission, reviewing the systematized process’s current on-earth experiment will give a clear view and reliable data result, which will gather more productivity for the systematized approach.
